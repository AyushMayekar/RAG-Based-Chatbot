## RAG-Based Document Chatbot

Welcome to the RAG-Based Document Chatbot repository! This project is an AI-powered chatbot that answers questions based solely on the content of provided documents. By utilizing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principle, the chatbot retrieves relevant information and generates accurate responses, making it a valuable tool for efficient knowledge management.

## Key Features

- **Context-Specific Responses**: The chatbot provides answers strictly based on the content of the uploaded document.
- **Advanced Retrieval Mechanism**: Leverages the RAG framework to retrieve the most relevant portions of the document for accurate and context-aware answers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for simplicity and ease of interaction, making it easy to upload documents and get immediate responses.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Backend development and FastAPI integration.
- **LangChain**: For document loading, splitting, and vector store management.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Vector storage and retrieval mechanism using MongoDB Atlas.
- **FastAPI**: Framework for building the REST API.
- **Ollama Embeddings**: For creating document embeddings and improving retrieval accuracy.
